## theoretical question
# are there higher levels of state violence in places where removal / erasure 
# has been less successful? violence is a means to erasure and colonization and 
# will line up with broader structures (legal, econ, cultural, etc) of 
# local / regional / federal settler colonialism
# departing from glenn, racial / settler territoriality, basically
# street-level agents of empire continue core goals of settler colonialism
# periodization and politics of goals contingent on local structural conditions

##### empirical questions
# 0. Violence correlates across policy domains (CJ, CPS)
# 1. Violence will be proportionally higher where larger shares of 
# AIAN people live on/near homelands or reservations (land contestation)
# 2. Violence will correlate with the timing of federal indian policy and statehood 
# (historical regimes of federal policy matter), statehood timing is predictive
# likely in a non-linear pattern, eg sync up to T's historical periods
# 3. Violence will correlate with efforts to limit sovereign power (pl280)
# 4. Violence will be constrained where tribal governments have 
# high institutional capacity in intergovernmental relations

# META METHOD
### START WITH BASELINE CORRELATIONS, THEN WALK THROUGH REGRESSIONS THAT 
### EXPLAIN VARIANCE IN VIOLENCE - THIS WILL BE COOL

### 0. Violence correlates across policy domains (CJ, CPS, premature death (maybe)?)
### compute exposure to outcomes at lowest level of geography feasible
### compute correlations between exposure rates to systems, co-occurence of violence
### at the place level

### t notes: ask ppl to critique it hard - are the qs clear and compellin?
### right audience to be interested but not sympathetic - how do I convince a crim
### audience, what do you need me to account for

### progress notes: NPS is dubious but likely best, setting up for trial runs with imp==1,
### will loop over all imps with bayesian, then pool for analysis
### 1/31: added NPS, added census tribal areas pop, built a few models

### PROJECT MERGE: From sov shields, bring inst data
#### from sov pol, bring age_spec and map


#### PROGRESSION OF RESULTS
## PANE MAP WITH EACH OUTCOME (3x)
## PANE MAP WITH EACH PREDICTOR (CRUDE)

### REGRESSIONS WITH E(FC), E(INCAR)





#### 2/16 DATA NOTES
## STATE INCAR IS GOING TO BE THIN
### GOING TO ADD DATA ON JAILS FROM BJS REPORT
### AND FIGURE OUT FEDERAL CUSTODY INMATES IN NPS
### NPS FOR STATE INCAR, CensofJails for Jail pop (via BJS report)
### BOP OFFENDER IN PRISON AT YEAR END for fed data
### GOING TO USE VERA FOR JAIL DATA
### Feds report only 2887 AIAN prisoners in 2018; I see over 60k state prisoners
